Hi, Iâ€™m @Tyrannide, i got my Master student in computer science following the Data and Connected System (DSC) at University Jean Monnet in 2024. 

I'm currently an employee at Bureau Veritas working as the project chief for the update and upgrade of their software based on LabWare's LIMS solution, along with that come a lot of automation project for every machine we have in all laboratories with some optimization for our computer park.

Always inteterested to discover some obscure knowledge and non-trivial subject about programming and Science, for lighter subject some nice creepypasta or Video games is always a sure bet.
